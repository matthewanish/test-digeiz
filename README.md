The JSON file contains trajectory data. We follow the movement of several people on the (X,Y) plane. Each person is identified by a specific ID. Its position at time t is indicated by the triplet (time, x, y) but the data of a trajectory are not ordered.
Using React, as well as all other libraries that seem relevant, propose a visualization of the path of these people in the plane (X, Y) as well as key metrics (for example the duration of a journey, the average speed, the number of stops...).
The desired deliverable is a repo with your source code, as well as a simple way to visualize the rendering (for example a link to a static hosting platform after deploying the code - https://matthewanish.github.io/test-digeiz-task/).
